# 📊 Sentiment Analysis on GLO Telecommunication Customers

This project performs **sentiment analysis** on customer feedback and complaints about **GLO Nigeria**, focusing on key service categories: **customer service**, **data plans**, **quality of service (QoS)**, and **tariff plans**. The goal is to extract actionable insights from user opinions to help improve customer experience and service delivery.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

To analyze and classify the sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in textual reviews provided by GLO customers using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.

## 🔍 Data Overview

Collected and cleaned user-generated textual data from:

* GLO customer service complaints
* GLO data plan feedback
* GLO tariff plan reactions
* General QoS concerns

Each `.csv` contains:

* **`comment`**: textual feedback
* **`label`**: (manually or automatically assigned) sentiment category

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas / NumPy** – data preprocessing
* **NLTK / SpaCy / Scikit-learn** – NLP and feature extraction
* **TF-IDF Vectorizer** – text representation
* **Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM** – classification algorithms
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn / WordCloud** – data visualization

---

## 🧪 Workflow Summary

### 1. 📥 Data Preprocessing

* Data cleaning (removing special characters, stopwords, lowercasing)
* Tokenization & lemmatization
* Label encoding and null handling

### 2. 🔠 Text Vectorization

* Applied **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to transform text into numerical format

### 3. 🧠 Model Training

Trained multiple classification models:

* **Logistic Regression**
* **Naive Bayes**
* **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

### 4. 📊 Evaluation Metrics

Each model was evaluated using:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* Confusion Matrix

---

## 📈 Visualizations

* WordCloud of frequently used terms
* Sentiment distribution bar plots
* Model accuracy comparison
* Confusion matrix heatmaps

---

## ✅ Results

* Best performing model: **\[e.g., Logistic Regression]** with an F1-score of \~**\[X]**
* Dominant sentiment in customer feedback: **\[e.g., Negative (62%)]**
* Highlighted recurring pain points in QoS and data pricing

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

* Integrate **deep learning models** (LSTM, BERT) for better semantic understanding
* Develop a **web dashboard** to upload new comments and see predicted sentiments in real time
* Extend analysis to **multi-language feedback**
* Build **topic modeling** around complaint categories
