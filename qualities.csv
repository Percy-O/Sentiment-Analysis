"Dear  

Help Nigerians.

Please!

The Quality of Service rendered by   glo and Airtel is rubbish.

Their internet and other infrastructure should be audited for QC checks.",Weak
MTN network has been very bad for users in these past few days. They are slowly replacing GLO. My advice is for y'all to settle for Airtel. The truth is the quality of service delivered by these ISP providers has dropped badly. None is one hundred percent trustworthy.,Weak
" Same here. MTN, Glo, etc. have cheating their customers on data and call rates as poor quality of service",Weak
" Ever since you changed from   to  your quality of service has steady declined year in year out. Can’t believe I enjoyed better network service in 2013, compare to 2022, completely undependable, had to buy an extra glo router just incase. You guys😡😡",Strong
Glo needs to slow down on all these ads and focus on improving quality of service.,Weak
 Pls do o. The quality of service glo gives is a human rights violation.,Neutral
   Glo will not grow to any thing since their only investment to improve the quality of service is to have 'glo ambassador'.,Neutral
"   How? Which local telco provides the quality of service MTN has?

Does Glo or 9Mobile have the proper management to even attract foreign investment for infrastructural expansion?

See ehn, thank God for MTN in Nigeria",Weak
"I wouldn't think I'd ever post this from a Glo SIM: ""9mobile is hot trash"".
I just lost what would have been a productive day. These networks give us no baseline quality of service, they're business risks.",Strong
"  Switched to Glo in September, it's been night and day in terms of quality of service compared to Comcast.  Plus, I never have to deal with the world's worst customer service again.  Strongly recommend switching",Weak
 glo should invest in infrastructure to be at per or above their major competitors in respect to quality of service not spending millions on adverts to promote inefficient network.,Strong
" I'm bringing this to your notice as a patriotic citizen of this country.
Glo network is getting bad by d day especially data service,it is no where near other major competitors in terms of quality of service &amp; I'm afraid glo may end up like other Nigerian company b4 it.",Weak

The truth is even with their dark moments of disappointments MTN still remains the best service provider in this country. We all expected Glo to do better but obviously they are more concerned about the number of mast they put up rather than the quality of service they provide.,Strong
"You people will use your entire days of the week to drag Glo network, only to borrow WiFi connection from Glo users to shade Airtel and MTN and 9mobile for poor quality of service.",Weak
"Kindly restore services to what is used to be. you can increase price and yet alter the plan or quality of service. Also, in the past 1week your network has been so erratic that have to substitute with GLO. I have attached a picture of the mail received as evidence.",Strong

"But again, the quality of service differs with location. Glo is really great where I stay but the moment I get to Third Mainland, it is downright crap. 9mobile used to be great at some point but I think they have lost it.  Fibre One comes highly recommended but it's not mobile.",Strong
 This means we will all have to change our devices and sims all over again without any significant change in quality of service! E.G. Glo has been the worst data network since they went 4g. It will be worse when 5g hits!,Weak
"There's clearly a collusion amongst these telecom companies in Nigeria, Glo, Airtel and the rest. No one seems to be different in its charges and quality of service.",Strong
 why is glo network so poor on acme road both voice and data is extremely bad quality of service?,Weak
"   GPRS/EDGE of other networks is far better than Glo 4G (even 5G) in 85% of their coverage areas.

From most of the comments here, I hope   and the owner, really feels the pulse of subscribers and improve their network Quality of Service",Strong
 Don't even try it.. There quality of service will drastically reduce just like Glo,Neutral
"   Glo has developed their services, it is fast, liable and better in price than MTN, but the problem is once a Nigerian company gets monopoly of a market their prices go up and quality of service goes down. If we can change this, then we are good.",Strong
 Why is glo 4G band only on band 28...700mhz.?it's restrictive for most new smartphone users please... Improve your quality of service if you truly want better customers...! Now i have to look out for other available options since my smartphone doesn't support the band...!🙄🙄😑,Strong
" I like this testimony. However, my issue with Glo is Quality of Service. That’s why I use 9mobile which is more expensive but their data dey like Chinese 4g - Super fast.",Strong
" Good day Glo
I've been using Glo 4 like 3months nw but the quality of service seems to be depreciating everyday.
I'm not happy I can't exhaust my bonuses bcos of no network &amp; u guys told me that my Gionee X1S is not compatible with my 4G sim please reply.",Strong
"Glo is very poor in service delivery this days, many people are angry about this, glo is our own but need to improve on quality of service.",Strong
